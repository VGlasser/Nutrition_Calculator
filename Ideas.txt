    * Get info on what foods people eat geographically and compare it to data on what stores and services are available then sell data

Features:
    * Compare to average diet (find out how to determine average diet)
    * Ex. someone has 240% of the recomended nutrients relative to the average diet (North American maybe?)
    * Graphic showing the percentile of users the user is for dietary fulfilment
    * Figure out cookies and user security features
    

TO DO:
    * Understand how AddFood retrieves data from the server
    * Finish displaying database data to the screen
    * Make smaller queries to retrieve data dynamically instead of copying all data to the system
    * Calculations for nutrient totals vs recomended nutrients

Extras:
    * Start looking for free visuals (Or make my own)
    * Maybe use AI art for simple button graphics?
