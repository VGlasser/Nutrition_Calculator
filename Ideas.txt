TO DO:
    * Understand how AddFood retrieves data from the server

        Removed salt as nutrient since database does not include it!!!
    * EXPLORE FOOD:
        Custom Portion: Once food selected, modify the measurement. Use formula: (New serving size/Original serving size)*ConversionFactorValue 
        Efficiency: Retrieve 10 foods from the database at a time. Use GET request from server maybe??
